            <h3>Queensborough Community College</h3>
            <h2>Digital Art and Design</h2>
            <h4>Degree: A.S </h4>
            <p>The A.S. degree program in Digital Art and Design is structured to prepare students to enter the greatly expanding field of new media, a field which has been revolutionized in the last 20 years with the advent of computer graphics programs. In addition to four basic courses that provide a solid background in art, students take five courses in digital art and design, which develop computer skills for fine and applied arts. A required course in the History of Graphic Design gives students an overview of graphic design in historical context. A suggested Art History elective provides a broad knowledge of art in general. With this preparation, students will be able to design for industry.
            </p>
            <p>
Upon successful completion of the Digital Arts program requirements, students will be able to: <span class="orange-color">Associate in Science degree (A.S.)</span> Demonstrate an understanding of the principles of design and their application in addressing ideas, both symbolically and expressively. </p>
