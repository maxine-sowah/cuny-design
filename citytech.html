            <h4>Degree: A.S </h4>
            <p>The curriculum builds on a study of big ideas where communication design is interpreted through multiple media channels using creative, effective and sustainable metrics.

The BFA degree, building on the solid foundation in visual expression of the first two years, develops students' abilities to frame, research and solve increasingly complex visual communication problems. Students develop a professional portfolio that represents their talents and prepares them for employment upon graduation as art directors, graphic designers, illustrators and web designers. They are also qualified to apply for masters programs in related communication design fields. COMD faculty and students benefit from a diverse mix of professional backgrounds and experiences. The COMD department is uniquely positioned to offer a rigorous and reflective college education to prepare graduates for life-long learning.
